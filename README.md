# High-School-Web-Assignment

This is a website I made for an assignment which was centered around purchasing jerseys. 
It incorporated MySQL and PHP by using phpmyadmin to provide users 
with the ability to login, sign up, make purchases, admin login, purchase and account manipulation.

NOTE: Database functionality no longer works due to non-existing database. 
This project will showcase the front-end design of the website
